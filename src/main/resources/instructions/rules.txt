HOW TO PLAY

1) Setup:
    a) At the start of the game each player rolls a dice to decide the order in which they play (highest=first, lowest=last);
        players that roll the same number will roll again to decide who goes first between them. Each player is assigned a color.
    b) After shuffling the deck of objectives, each player is given one card, the first player to complete his objective wins.
    c) After shuffling the deck of territories, 42 cards are distributed one by one to the players. These are the territories
        the players start with.
    c) Players take turns (following the order determined at 1a) placing 3 troops at a time on their territories. The players can 
        place them however they want: all in one territory or distributed between their territories. This process continues
        until there are no more troops. NOTE: each territory MUST have at least one troop.

2) Player turns:
    a) At the start of his turn, the player gains a number of troops based on the number of territories he owns:
        number_of_territories / 3 (rounded down). If the player owns all the territories of a continent he also gains more troops
        based on the continent:
        Oceania => 2 troops          Europe => 5 troops
        South America => 2 troops    North America => 5 troops
        Africa => 3 troops           Asia => 7 troops
    b) The player can play a combination of 3 army cards to gain more troops:
        3 cannons => 4 troops
        3 infantry => 6 troops       
        3 knights => 8 troops
        1 infantry, 1 cannon, 1 knight => 10 troops
        How the cards are drawn is explained at 1c.
    c) After deploying new troops in his territories, the player can attack or move his troops. To attack he has to choose
        a neighboring enemy territory and declare how many troops he wants to deploy for the attack (remember there has to be
        at least one tank not in combat that stays in the territory). Both the attacking player and the defending player throw 
        dices based on the number of troops deployed (max 3). The dices with the highest result are confronted in pairs, the 
        losing dice indicates that the owner has to remove it from his territory; in case of a draw, the defender wins.
        Each time a territory is conquered, the attacking player draws a card from the deck of army cards.
        If the defending player lost all his troops in his territory, the attacking player can move his troops from the territory
        e.g. p1 attacks p2 by using 3 troops, p2 has 5 troops on his territory but decides to defend with two:
             p1 rolls 3, 1, 5
             p2 rolls 6, 2
             6 > 5 => p1 loses a tank
             3 > 2 => p2 loses a tank
             by using only 2 troops p2 avoided the risk of losing 2 troops and instead lost only 1, but if he had deployed
             another he would have won, since any result would have been higher or equal 1, also if the third dice resulted
             in a 6 he wouldn't have lost a single tank. Using more dices can increase the chances of winning.
    d) During his turn, the player can attack as many times as he wants (as long as he has enough troops). He can also move his
        troops between his territories (leaving minimum 1 tank), but after this his turn ends.
